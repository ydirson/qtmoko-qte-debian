This patch changes QObjectPrivateVersion, thus preventing mixing
parts of upstream Qt and qt-copy. In general it is a bad idea to mix
e.g. libQtCore from one build and libQtGui from another one, and other
qt-copy patches could make changes in Qt internal structures that could
cause problems when mixed with upstream Qt.

This patch does not make qt-copy binary incompatible with upstream Qt.
It only further enforces using the same sources for the whole Qt build.
