  * Fix generic atomic header. (Closes: #475767)
    This is enough to fix building of kdelibs, but there should be a proper
    hppa fix modelled over the other "real" archs.

  +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Add qt-copy patch:
    * 0230-qtextcontrol-selectnextword
      Fix Ctrl+Shift+Right in a khtml textarea when having more than one tab
      open: QTextEdit should react to ShortcutOverride for the keys it handles
      (was already partly done).

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Steal 73_from4.4.1_no_AAAA_when_ipv6_disabled.diff patch from 4.4.1
    snapshot, which disables IPv6 DNS queries (AAAA) when IPv6 is disabled on
    the system.

  +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Split html documentation in qt4-doc-html package.
  * Merge Ubuntu patches:
    * Add lpia architecture in trusted dpkg-arch over uname.
    * Add sqlite3 workaround in config tests fixes.
  * Add qt-copy patch:
    * 0227-qdatastream-regression
      Fix a bug that causes all Qt3/2 applications to crash or hang under KDE4.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Add 16_qsortfilterproxymodel_invalidate_noscroll.diff patch which stops
    scrolling to the current item/index on QSortFilterProxyModel::invalidate()
    This patch has been scheduled for Qt 4.4.1 (TT #204403).
  * Add missing Replaces:
    - libqt4-opengl-dev replaces libqt4-dev (<< 4.4.0-2) due to obvious
      reasons.
    - libqt4-dev replaces libqt4-opengl-dev (<< 4.4.0-2) (due to qglobal.h
      misplace).

qt4-x11 (4.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Split OpenGL headers from libqt4-dev to libqt4-opengl-dev:
    - Update install files.
    - Make libqt4-opengl-dev depend on X OpenGL headers, hence remove the
      latter from libqt4-dev Recommends.
    - Add libqt4-opengl-dev to libqt4-dev Recommends.
    - Remove libq4-opengl from libqt4-dev Depends.
  * Explicitly add libqtcore4 to libqt4-dev (was implicit before).
  * Rename libqt4-gui to libqtgui4 (new package).
  * Make libqt4-gui a transitional package (Closes: #478694) depending on
    libqtgui4, libqt4-opengl (Closes: #478264), libqt4-sql, libqt4-designer,
    libqt4-assistant.
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${source:Version} in dependencies of
    libqt4-core and libqt4-gui transitional packages.
  * Require just libqtcore4 to install libqt4-dbg instead of libqt4-gui.
  * Resync patches:
    - 05_append_qt4_target.diff - fix offsets.
    - 11_qdbus_to_dbus_fix.diff - remove, merged upstream.
    - Revert to "runtime" configuration for xcursor, xinerama, xfixes and drop
      16_always_init_qt_x11data_ptrx.diff patch. Fixed upstream.

  +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Update libqt4-dev and libqt4-opengl-dev install to use complete files
    list instead of wildcard.
  * Update installed files: new qt help and assistant translations.
  * Add qt-copy patch:
    * 0226-qtreeview-column_resize_when_needed
      This patch assures that if no header is shown, or if we only have one
      column (so no other columns become shrinked), the contents will be
      visible.

qt4-x11 (4.4.0~rc1-5) unstable; urgency=high

  +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Add libqt4-sql-sqlite dependency to qt4-dev-tools. Qt Assistant and
    qhelpgenerator use the sqlite plugin. (Closes: #476986)
  * Remove qt-copy patches 0191 and 0192. The relevant code has changed
    such that neither patch seems to have any effect (although listviews
    still do not use active/inactive roles correctly).
  * Add qt-copy patches:
    * 0223-fix-qpixmap-hasalpha
      Fix a performance regression in QPixmap::hasAlpha() in Qt 4.4.
    * 0224-fast-qpixmap-fill
      This patch avoids the expensive image->pixmap conversion by discarding
      the old pixmap, creating a new one with the correct format, and doing
      the fill server side.
    * 0225-invalidate-tabbar-geometry-on-refresh
      Fix problem where Konsole's tab bar is not shown immediately on startup.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Downgrade libqt4-dev *gl*-dev dependencies to Recommends.
    They pull in half of X11 development headers and are rarely needed.
    What's more, OpenGL apps will probably depend on them explicitly anyway.
  * Add development packages of the SQL plugins to libqt4-dev Suggests.
  * Make libqt4-sql recommend its plugins. Depends does not do us any good
    because we don't know which plugin a user is going to use anyway. Moreover
    installation of the libqt4-sql package does not necessarily imply usage of
    the specific plugin(s). Finally, this resolves circular dependencies among
    libqt4-sql and its plugins.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Add 16_always_init_qt_x11data_ptrx.diff, which ensures that X11->ptrX*
    are properly initialized when Xcursor, Xinerama, Xfixes are not available
    in default "runtime" configuration  (Closes: #476608).
  * Pass -xfixes -xcursor -xinerama to configure because default "runtime"
    configuration requires a user to have libxfixes-dev, libxcursor-dev and
    libxinerama-dev installed to enable features requires respective X
    libraries (QLibrary simply searches for "lib*.so"). This change in
    configuration makes 16 patch irrelevant for Debian, but I'm leaving it
    as it's still the fix for the crashes which might occur on default Qt 4.4
    configutions.
  * Optimize qmake: pass -optimized-qmake to configure.

qt4-x11 (4.4.0~rc1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Sune Vuorela:

  * Have libqt4-dev conflict/replace libqtwebkit-dev.
  * Fix qmake to generate a bit better pkg-config files. Those should usually
    not be generated - as it ends up being crackful. After a bit of patching
    they are a bit less crackful though. (Closes: 457570)
  * Postprocess prl files to remove the same crack as in the pc files.
    (Closes: 470572)
  * Do a bit nicer linking when needed instead of relying on crackfulness from
    prl and pc files.
  * Add a disabled patch to generate better prl files, but unfortunately too
    much of qt4 build process relies on on it and is not yet fixed, but it is
    saved for later use.
  * Fix qmake makefile generation - should not add double slashes to
    makefiles.
  * Make libqt4-core transitional package arch:any. It doesn't bloat the
    archive too much, but it helps on installability.

  +++ Changes by Matthew Rosewarne:

  * Add Recommends: qt4-doc to qt4-demos.
  * Add watch file.

  +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Add libqt4-svg dependency to libqt4-gui. It helps for the transition as
    libQtSvg.so.4 was previously in libqt4-gui package. (Closes: #475324)
  * Replace libqcncodecs.so in libqt4-gui (<< 4.4.0~beta1-1). (Closes: #475340)
  * Update 20_mips_atomic_ops patch. Qt4.4 introduced two new atomic operations

qt4-x11 (4.3.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [Fathi Boudra]
  * Update 01_qmake_for_debian patch. Add DEFINES += QT_SHARED in qmake.conf
    along with the removal of link_prl. (Closes: #434019)
  * Apply qt-copy patches:
    * 00_0185-fix-format-strings: This patch fixes various code issues with
      handling format strings. None of them seem to be exceptionally bad,
      but its better safe than sorry. It is related to CVE-2007-3388.
      TT claims the problem is not present in any version of Qt 4. Dirk Muller
      disagrees and believes that some of them are possible to exploit.
    * 00_0186-fix-component-alpha-text: This patch fixes component alpha
      (LCD hinted) text when it's drawn on a non-opaque background. Qt doesn't
      initialize the alpha channel in the glyph masks, which causes problems
      in Konsole when transparency is enabled, and in other situations where
      the background isn't fully opaque.

      uic_location are properly in pkgconfig files. (See bug #401807)
    * 06_qtdemo_destdir: remove QT_BUILD_TREE in qtdemo DESTDIR target.
      (Closes: #408639)
  * Revert Qt handling argb visuals on X11 patch. There are dependencies

  [Brian Nelson]
  * Changed dist back to unstable.
  * Tightened qt4-dev-tools's dependency on libqt4-core to

    Qt whose ABI can change. (Closes: #429817)
  * Added a build-dependency on libxi-dev to enable tablet support.
  * Constrict the hack to clean all binary files to the bin, config.tests,
    and qmake directories to drastically improve its speed

    * 00_0163-fix-gcc43-support: Various fixes to get Qt 4.3 without hundreds
      of warnings compiling.
    * 00_0167-fix-group-reading: In big user environments, getgrgid_r() needs
      more memory than sysconf() returns.

    * 00_0176-coverity-fixes: Fix various obvious memory leaks.

    the last version.  Also removed some unneeded dependencies.

  * Split the *_debug.so symlinks out of libqt4-dev and into a separate
    libqt4-debug-dev package.  Made the libqt4-debug-dev package depend on
    the Source-Version of libqt4-debug.  This way, the symlinks won't be
    dangling if libqt4-debug isn't installed and prevents failed linking
    due to version mismatches.  (Closes: #346603, #346605)

  * Re-enabled sqlite3 support.  It's still statically linked, however,
    but that'll have to do because I really don't want to futz with the

    alpha. (Closes: #347353)

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_for_debian: renamed from
    10_qmake_use_qt4_tools, and updated to remove the "link_prl" from the

  * debian/control: replaced obsolete xlibs-dev dependency with the

  * Completely disabled SQLite support since it's too fubar in this

    (Closes: #330094)

  * Moved the plugins installed in libqt4-core to libqt4-gui, since they
    link against the GUI library.  Otherwise a circular libqt4-core <->
    libqt4-gui dependency results.

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_use_qt4_tools.dpatch: new patch that modifies
    qmake.conf so that qmake generates Makefiles that use the -qt4 tools.
    This way, it can cope with systems that have alternatives set to use
    the -qt3 versions.

  * Increased the conflicting Qt3 package versions to <= 3.3.4-7, since
    the Qt3 packages still don't use the alternatives system as needed to
    coexist with Qt4.

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added /usr/lib/qt4/plugins/codecs

  * debian/patches/11_launch_assistant-qt4: new patch that modifies the
    QAssistantClient class to launch Qt Assistant as "assistant-qt4" to
    cope with the alternatives system (Closes: #327294)

  * debian/control: Upgraded libqt4-dev's dependencies on the modules
    libqt4-sql and libqt4-qt3support from suggests to depends, and added
    libpq-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev | libmysqlclient-dev as
    dependencies.  These dependencies are apparently required to make
    building pkg-config-using packages happy. (Closes: #327618)

  * debian/control: corrected libqt4-sql to suggest libmysqlclient14-dev,
    not libmysqlclient12-dev which is deprecated

  * debian/copyright: updated FSF snailmail address

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: removed the libqt3supportwidgets_debug.so
    designer plugin, since for some reason having this installed breaks
    designer (Closes: #325782)

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Install changes-4.0.1 as upstream changelog

  * debian/manpages/assistant-qt4.1: new manpage written from scratch
    based on the output of "assistant -help"

  * debian/manpages/designer-qt4.1, debian/manpages/linguist-qt4.1:
    manpages stolen from the Qt3 packages and trivially adapted for Qt4
    (Closes: #322403)

  * debian/manpages/moc-qt4.1: escape some '-' characters

  * debian/qt4-dev-tools.manpages: install the new assistant-qt4.1,
    designer-qt4.1, and linguist-qt4.1 manpages

  * debian/control: made qt4-dev-tools recommend qt4-doc, since assisant
    needs it to be useful (Closes: #323251)

  * Removed the FAQ from qt4-doc.docs, since it's no longer included in
    4.0.1, and was useless anyway

  * Build-depend on libmysqlclient14-dev since libmysqlclient12-dev is
    scheduled to be removed

  * debian/libqt4-dev.install: work around TT's broken "install" target in
    this release so that the pkgconfig files are installed in
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig instead of directly in /usr/lib.  Grrrr.

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed the xlibs-pic dependency to xlibs-static-pic
    for the X.org transition (Closes: #319586)

  * Added manpages for lrelease, lupdate, moc, qtconfig, and uic, stolen
    from the Qt3 upstream tarball, and wrote a manpage for qmake from
    scratch.  Since now manpages are included for all executables using
    the alternatives, the symlinks to them no longer dangle.
    (Closes: #319456)

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added
    usr/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats/libqjpeg.so to include the jpeg
    plugin (Closes: #321582)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: added the libqjpeg_debug.so plugin

  * debian/rules: don't hardcode the /usr/include/postgresql/8.0 path,
    instead of the output of `pg_config --includedir`, stolen from Qt3
    packages

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added the OpenGL module library so that it
    actually gets included in a package (Closes: #321874)

  * debian/control: updated the package descriptions to note that the
    Network and XML modules are included in the libqt4-core package, and
    the OpenGL module is included in the libqt4-gui package

  * Transition to the new X.org packages:
    + (Build-)depend on libglu1-xorg-dev instead of xlibmesa-gl-dev
    + (Build-)depend on libxinerama-dev (Closes: #318682)
